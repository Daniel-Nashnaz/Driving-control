The real-time driving control system was developed in response to growing concerns about transportation safety. Many accidents on the road are caused by reckless driving, and there is a need for a system that can help prevent these accidents. The system is designed to collect real-time data on drivers' driving behavior and provide alerts if they are not driving safely. This data is then stored in a database, allowing parents and managers to access it at any time and see all their trip data. Such a system is important for several reasons. First, it allows parents to monitor their children's driving behavior and ensure that they drive safely. This is especially important for new drivers who may be more accident prone. Second, it allows transportation company managers to monitor the driving behavior of their drivers and ensure that they follow safety protocols. This can help prevent accidents and improve the overall safety of the transportation system. Finally, such a system can help improve transportation safety by providing real-time alerts and warnings when unsafe driving behavior is detected. This can help prevent accidents before they happen and save lives on the road. Overall, the real-time driving control system is an important tool for improving transportation safety and ensuring drivers drive safely. By collecting real-time data on driving behavior and providing alerts and warnings when unsafe behavior is detected, the system can help prevent accidents and save lives on the road.
