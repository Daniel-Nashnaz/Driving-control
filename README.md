# Driving Control - Spring Boot API

This backend service is the core of the Driving Control system, designed to improve transportation safety by monitoring and analyzing drivers' behavior in real time.

The system collects driving data such as speed, braking, acceleration, and alerts for unsafe driving patterns. This information is securely stored in a database, allowing parents and fleet managers to review driving history and ensure compliance with safety standards.

By providing real-time alerts and detailed trip reports, the system helps prevent accidents and promotes responsible driving habits. It is especially valuable for parents monitoring young drivers and transportation companies overseeing professional drivers.

This service includes user registration and authentication with JWT, driver and vehicle management, trip data handling, and report generation. Data is stored using MongoDB for trip information and SQL databases for user and system management.

Overall, the Driving Control API is a vital tool for enhancing road safety through technology, helping reduce accidents and saving lives by encouraging safer driving behavior.
